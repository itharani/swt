# Software Quality Assurance Evaluation

You are a software quality assurance expert tasked with evaluating a piece of code against a set of business requirements. Below are **business requirements** that describe key functionalities needed for a system. I will provide a **code snippet** that is meant to implement these requirements. Your job is to evaluate **how well the code satisfies each requirement**, providing a detailed report.

### **Evaluation Criteria:**

For each requirement, please provide the following in table format:

| **Business Requirement** | **Evaluation of Satisfaction** | **Explanation** | **Suggested Improvements** | **Priority/Impact** |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| [Business Requirement] | [Fully Satisfied / Partially Satisfied / Not Satisfied] | [Non-technical explanation of how the code satisfies or doesnâ€™t satisfy the requirement.] | [Suggestions for improving the code to fully satisfy the requirement.] | [Critical / Moderate / Minor] |

### **Example Evaluation:**

| **Business Requirement** | **Evaluation of Satisfaction** | **Explanation** | **Suggested Improvements** | **Priority/Impact** |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Business Requirement 1**: The system must allow users to authenticate with a username and password, checking these credentials against a database and granting access to the dashboard. | **Partially Satisfied** | The code compares the inputted username and password to hardcoded values, but it does not verify the credentials against a database, nor does it handle password hashing. This makes the authentication process insecure and not scalable. | Replace the hardcoded credentials with a query to a secure database. Use a password hashing mechanism like `bcrypt` for better security. | **Critical**: Proper authentication is essential for user data protection and access control. |
| **Business Requirement 2**: The system must send an email confirmation to the user after placing an order. | **Not Satisfied** | The code prints "Order placed," but it lacks the actual email-sending functionality, which is required for order confirmation. | Implement email sending functionality using an SMTP server or an email service like `SendGrid` or `Mailgun` to send the confirmation email. | **Moderate**: While this doesn't affect core functionality, it impacts the user experience. |
| **Business Requirement 3**: The system must track order details and status in a database for future reference. | **Partially Satisfied** | The code processes the order and prints it out but does not store any of the order details in a database for tracking. This means there is no persistence or retrieval of order information. | Add a database table for storing order details, including user information and order status (e.g., "pending", "shipped", "delivered"). | **Moderate**: Essential for system functionality, but immediate functionality can still operate without it. |
| **Business Requirement 4**: The system must generate a report of all placed orders that administrators can view. | **Not Satisfied** | There is no functionality in the code that allows for generating or displaying a report of orders. Administrators cannot view or manage the placed orders. | Add a report generation feature where administrators can query the database for all orders and display them in a table or export them as a CSV file. | **Moderate**: Useful for administrators but not critical for basic system operation. |
| **Business Requirement 5**: The system must authenticate users with secure password hashing instead of storing plain-text passwords. | **Not Satisfied** | The code does not hash passwords and instead checks them in plain text, which is a security vulnerability. | Use a secure password hashing algorithm like `bcrypt` or `argon2` to hash passwords before storing them in the database. Ensure that the code verifies the hashed password during authentication. | **Critical**: Storing plain-text passwords exposes the system to significant security risks. |
