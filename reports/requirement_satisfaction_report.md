| **Business Requirement** | **Evaluation of Satisfaction** | **Explanation** | **Suggested Improvements** | **Priority/Impact** |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Input Requirements**: The user must provide monthly income, credit score, and loan amount requested. | **Fully Satisfied** | The code prompts the user to input their monthly income, credit score, and loan amount requested, which aligns with the input requirements. | None | **Minor**: Input collection is correctly implemented. |
| **Eligibility Rules**: The user is eligible if monthly income is at least $3000, credit score is 500 or higher, and loan amount does not exceed 4 times monthly income. | **Fully Satisfied** | The `is_eligible` method correctly implements the eligibility rules by checking each condition and returning appropriate messages. | None | **Critical**: Correct eligibility checking is crucial for the application's core functionality. |
| **Output Requirements**: Display eligibility message and reasons for ineligibility. | **Fully Satisfied** | The code returns a message indicating eligibility or the specific reason(s) for ineligibility, which is then printed to the user. | None | **Moderate**: Clear output is important for user understanding. |
| **Input Validation**: Validate that monthly income and loan amount are positive numbers, and credit score is between 300 and 850. | **Partially Satisfied** | The code checks if the loan amount is positive but does not validate that monthly income is positive or that the credit score is within the specified range. | Add checks to ensure monthly income is positive and credit score is between 300 and 850. | **Critical**: Proper input validation prevents incorrect data processing. |
| **Performance**: Process input and display results within 1 second. | **Fully Satisfied** | The operations performed are simple arithmetic and condition checks, which are executed quickly, satisfying the performance requirement. | None | **Minor**: Performance is adequate for the current scope. |
| **Usability**: Provide clear and concise instructions for user input. | **Partially Satisfied** | The code prompts are straightforward, but additional instructions or examples could enhance clarity. | Include more detailed instructions or examples for each input prompt. | **Moderate**: Improved usability enhances user experience. |
| **Maintainability**: Code must be well-documented and easy to modify. | **Partially Satisfied** | The code is straightforward, but lacks comments explaining the logic, which could aid future modifications. | Add comments explaining the purpose of each method and key logic points. | **Moderate**: Better documentation aids future maintenance and updates. |
