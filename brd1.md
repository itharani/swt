2. Code should follow PEP8 coding standards.
3. The application should log errors and exceptions.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria
1. Running the application should allow a user to enter two numbers and select an operation.
2. The application should return the correct result for each operation.
3. If the user attempts division by zero, the application should return a warning message instead of throwing an error.

## 4. Constraints
1. The application should be a standalone script without dependencies on external libraries (except standard Python modules).
